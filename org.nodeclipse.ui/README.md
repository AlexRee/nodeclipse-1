> Say I have a feature that I build, it runs on top of the Eclipse Platform. I know Eclipse Galileo is coming out soon, so I download it and try it out with my feature.

> Oh No! It doesn't work! I've found a bug in the platform, and its a major blocker for me. (Oops, maybe I should have tried this a couple of months ago when there still would have been time to fix the bug.)

> Meta-Comment: The Eclipse Platform Project has a reputation for shipping on time (even if that means there are unresolved bugs). There is a strict end game plan that is followed for the release, lock down started back at the beginning of May. The further we are along in the plan, the harder it is to get a fix approved for release. A lot of people don't seem to relealize this happens, and perhaps wonder why their important bugs are defered with the comment "Its too late".
