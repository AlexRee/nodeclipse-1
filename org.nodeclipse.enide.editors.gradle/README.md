This is done to make minimalist Gradle Editor,
and play with Eclipse Editor API,
and then maybe find some foundation for Editors in Nodeclipse

If to continue, look at examples in `docs\`,
and \src\org\nodeclipse\enide\editors\gradle\highlight\Words.java

## To Develop

- Import `org.nodeclipse.enide.editors.gradle` as existing Eclipse project in Eclipse with PDE (e.g. Eclipse Standard)
- open `plugins.xml`
- click `Launch an Eclipse application in Debug mode`
