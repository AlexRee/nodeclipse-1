This is done to make minimalist Gradle Editor,
and play with Eclipse Editor API,
and then maybe find some foundation for Editors in Nodeclipse

If to continue, look at examples in `docs\`,
and [src/org/nodeclipse/enide/editors/gradle/highlight/Words.java](src/org/nodeclipse/enide/editors/gradle/highlight/Words.java)

## Using

Read first at <http://www.nodeclipse.org/projects/gradle>

## To Develop

- Import `org.nodeclipse.enide.editors.gradle` as existing Eclipse project in Eclipse with PDE (e.g. Eclipse Standard or Enide Studio)
- open `plugins.xml`
- click `Launch an Eclipse application in Debug mode`
