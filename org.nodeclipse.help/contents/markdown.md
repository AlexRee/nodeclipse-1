Title:  Nodeclipse Online Help - Markdown  

## Markdown

`npm` Node.js Package Manager assumes that every project has file README.md. It is good practice to have this file,
with minimal description of your project.

`.md` or `.markdown` are file with text in markdown format.
Markdown is markup language, a superset of HTML, with focus on content authoring (not design).

Markdown is default on <stackoverflow.com> and <github.com>
 ( see [Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)](.github-flavored-markdown.md.html))
