Title:  Nodeclipse Online Help - Configuration  

## Configuration

Some recommended configuration (These steps are needed for every new workspace):

Goto Window->Preferences 

General select Show heap status  
General->Workspace -> Text file encoding select other UTF-8  
(if Eclipse 4.x Chrome Theme installed (Optional, recommended) )  
General->Appearance ->Theme select Jeeeyul's themes - Chrome Theme, restart Eclipse  
Team -> Git -> History : Check "Follow renames"  

Switch to Node perspective (e.g. Window -> Open Perspective -> Other ... -> Node)

[REST Client Tool](http://www.nodeclipse.org/restclient-tool/) is also nice to use in Debug perspective.

<kbd>Window -> Show View -> Other... -> REST Client -> REST Client Tool</kbd>  
or <kbd>Ctrl+3</kbd> type `rest`


#### Optional general Eclipse configuration

General -> Workspace -> Refresh on access
General -> Workspace -> Refresh using native hooks or polling (so that you don't need to press <kbd>F5</kbd>
 after <code>npm install<code> or other changes on file system)
General -> Workspace -> Text file encoding - select UTF-8 

General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> Show print margin, 120

General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> Show whitespace characters (just remeber where is this setting)
 
Take a time to explore other Eclipse setting, you may be rewarded with findings. 

### Nodeclipse Preferences

Check preferences ( Window -> Preferences ) for Node.js, PhantomJS, MongoDB and Nashorn related settings.
