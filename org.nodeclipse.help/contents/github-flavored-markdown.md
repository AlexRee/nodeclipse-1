## Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)

Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) is extension of [Markdown by GitHub](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

> GitHub uses what we're calling "GitHub Flavored Markdown" (GFM) for messages, issues, and comments. It differs from standard Markdown (SM) in a few significant ways and adds some additional functionality.

> If you're not already familiar with Markdown, you should spend 15 minutes and go over the excellent Markdown Syntax Guide at Daring Fireball. Note that markup that's not covered by GFM can't be supplanted with HTML.

### Issue during Debug

So close it before you start your debugging session.

You can open it any time from Windows -> Show View -> GFM View
