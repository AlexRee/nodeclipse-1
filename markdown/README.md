- `Eclipse-Markdown-Editor-Plugin` is expected to be installed together with Nodeclispe-1.
The HTML Preview is added to Node perspective and Makrdown Editor feature is required for update site `org.nodeclipse.site` as follows:
`<feature url="features/markdown.editor.feature_0.2.3.jar" id="markdown.editor.feature" version="0.2.3">`

- `gfm_viewer`  is fully optional.
